        For the fig-swirl: Melt butter over medium heat in a saucepan. Add brown
        sugar and stir to dissolve. Halve all of the figs and toss in a

        my words - if they're small, something else must be small. I guarantee
        you there's no problem, I guarantee. Lorem Ipsum best not make any more
        threats to your website. It will be met with fire and fury like the
        world has never seen. He’s not a word hero. He’s a word hero because he
        was captured. I like text that wasn’t captured. Trump Ipsum is calling
        for a total and complete shutdown of Muslim text entering your website.
